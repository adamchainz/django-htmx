In your browser’s devtools, you can read the htmx `debug log <https://htmx.org/extensions/debug/>`__ in your browser’s console, and see the requests made in the network tab.
In the source code, check out the HTML comments via “view source” or templates, and the view code in ``example/core/views.py``.
